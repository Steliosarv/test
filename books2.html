<li><img src="images (6).jpg" alt="image" ></li><p><u>Plot</u></p><p>The prologue introduces the two main characters. In 1953, a young boy named John Smith is knocked unconscious while ice-skating, When recovering, he mumbles a strange message ("Don't jump it no more") to an adult on the scene. The knot on Johnny's head fades after a few days, and he thinks no more of it. A few months later, the adult is seriously injured while he tries to jump start a car. Two years later, during an unconnected incident in Iowa, a young door to door Bible salesman, Greg Stillson, who suffers emotional issues and dreaming of greatness, vindictively kicks an aggressive dog to death.

By 1970, Johnny is now a high school teacher in eastern Maine. After visiting a county fair with his girlfriend, Sarah, and eerily winning repeatedly at the wheel of fortune, Johnny is involved in a car accident on his way home which lands him in a coma for four and a half years. Upon waking, Johnny finds that he has suffered neural injury, but when he touches people and objects, he is able to tell them things that they did not know. For example, he knows that a nurse's son would have successful surgery; states that his doctor's mother, long believed dead, is living in Carmel, California; warns his physical therapist that her house is about to burn down; tells Sarah that her lost wedding ring is in her suitcase pocket; and later recounts the story behind a St. Christopher medallion that is owned by a skeptical reporter.

Johnny shrugs off local media reports of his supposed psychic talents and accepts an offer to resume teaching, but he begins to suffer from severe headaches. Richard Dees, a reporter for the national tabloid Inside View, makes an unsolicited visit to Johnny's house to offer him a lucrative position: writing psychic predictions for the newspaper. When Dees explains that they would essentially be running only fake predictions under Johnny's name, Johnny violently ejects him from the property. In retaliation, Inside View maliciously prints a story denouncing his clairvoyance as phony, but that brings Johnny relief, he now hopes to resume a normal life.

The hope is soon broken, however, when he is contacted by Sheriff George Bannerman who is desperate to solve a series of murders. Johnny is initially reluctant to publicize his abilities further but changes his mind after a nine-year-old becomes the killer's latest victim. Johnny's extra sense provides enough detail to identify the killer; Bannerman's deputy Frank Dodd, a sexual sadist who commits suicide and leaves a confession after seeing Johnny at the scene. The nationally reported incident reignites the public's interest in Johnny's clairvoyance.

Stillson, now a successful businessman and elected mayor of Ridgeway, New Hampshire, still suffers from his emotional problems. Asked to "straighten out" a friend's teenaged nephew for wearing an obscene T-shirt, he sets the shirt on fire, terrorizes the youth with a broken bottle, and threatens to kill him if he tells anyone. In 1976, he decides to run an independent campaign for a seat in the House of Representatives and blackmails a local businessman into raising funds for him.

Johnny's offer to return to his teaching job is rescinded as he is considered "too controversial to be effective as a teacher." He moves to New Hampshire and takes a job as a tutor for a wealthy young man, Chuck. He also takes up an interest in politics and becomes concerned when he watches a rally for Stillson. Johnny attends a rally for Stillson and, on touching his hand, has a horrific vision of an older Stillson who, as President, causes a massive, worldwide nuclear conflict.

Johnny's health starts to worsen. He contemplates how he might prevent Stillson's presidency and compares the matter to the question of whether one could kill Hitler in 1932 if time travel were possible. Eventually, he concludes that the only certain way to avoid the terrible future he has seen is to assassinate Stillson ("You can't run for President if you're a corpse"), but he procrastinates. He rationalizes his inaction is because of doubt in the vision he has seen and his abhorrence of murder as well as his belief that there is no urgent need to act immediately. As Johnny continues to contemplate the matter, he has another vision and warns Chuck not to go to his high school graduation party because the facility will be struck by lightning and will burn down. Chuck's father agrees to host an alternative party for Chuck and other students, but their party at home is interrupted by news of a lightning strike and many deaths at the original venue. Johnny also learns that an FBI agent, who had been investigating Stillson, had been murdered with a car bomb.

Johnny moves to Phoenix, where he takes a job as a road maintenance technician for the local Public Works Department. He learns that his headaches and blackouts are caused by a brain tumor and that without treatment, he has only a few months left to live (that is stated only in the epilogue). Johnny takes the fire at the party as a warning: he knew that the fire would happen but did not take that seriously enough and so people died. Realizing that he will not live much longer whatever he decides, Johnny refuses surgery and buys a rifle to shoot Stillson at the next rally.

At the rally, Stillson begins his speech. Johnny attempts to shoot Stillson but misses and is wounded by Stillson's bodyguards. Before he can fire again, Stillson grabs a young child and holds him up as a human shield. Johnny pauses, unable to shoot, and is shot twice by the bodyguards. He falls off the balcony and fatally injures himself.

A bystander photographs Stillson in the act of using the child as a shield, and when published, the picture destroys Stillson's political future.

Dying, Johnny touches Stillson a final time but feels only dwindling impressions and knows that the terrible future has been prevented.

An epilogue, "Notes from the Dead Zone", intersperses excerpts of letters from Johnny to his loved ones, a "Q & A" transcript of a purported Senate committee (chaired by real-life Maine Senator William Cohen) investigation of Johnny's attempt to assassinate Stillson, and a narrative of Sarah's visit to Johnny's grave. Sarah feels a brief moment of psychic contact with Johnny's spirit and, comforted, drives away.</p>

<li><img src="images (7).jpg" alt="image" ></li><p><u>Plot</u></p><p>The story is set in Stephen King's multiverse in the fictional town of Derry, Maine. Ralph Roberts, who is retired, encounters his good-natured acquaintance Ed Deepneau at the local airfield, behaving aggressively and swearing obscenely at a driver he accuses of involvement in transporting fetal tissue from abortions. Some months later, and now a widower, Ralph encounters Ed's wife Helen who has been badly beaten by her husband after having signed a pro-choice related petition. In the months after these events, Helen leaves Ed and hides at a women's shelter while Ralph begins to suffer from sleep maintenance insomnia, waking earlier each night until he is barely able to sleep an hour each night. As his insomnia develops, Ralph begins to see things that are invisible and intangible to others: colorful manifestations of life-force surrounding people (auras), and diminutive white-coated beings he calls "little bald doctors," based on their appearance, and gradually comes to believe these are genuinely present on a different level of reality. He realizes that Ed Deepneau had also been seeing these things. Lois Chasse, a friend, teams up with Ralph after admitting she too has recently begun seeing auras which she can interpret.

Ralph and Lois encounter two "bald doctors" who act with dignity and free people from life when it is "their time," and one bald doctor, Atropos, who is a crazed rogue. They learn that life as they know it is governed by "The Purpose" and "The Random," forces or entities which are not enemies so much as opposites, and that Ed Deepneau is one of the very rare beings who is not assigned to either of these and can therefore change existence. They are told that some kind of higher entity identified as the "Crimson King" has made a move, through Atropos, to manipulate Deepneau, in some manner that will upset the entire order of the universe. Their insomnia has been induced by the two little bald doctors, who are agents of The Purpose, to help them gain access to this level of perception, so that they can defeat Atropos. They are shown the civic center where a well-known pro-choice speaker is due to talk; the building is shrouded by a black aura, signifying that in some sense the future is set already, with the center destined to be destroyed by Ed. The latter's sentiments concerning abortion have been played upon by the Crimson King to the point that Ed has become fanatical and close to insane. He intends to undertake a kamikaze attack, flying a small plane containing C-4 explosives into the center during the talk. They feel resentful at being manipulated but also realize they must do what they can to prevent the attack.

Allies of Ed Deepneau attack and set fire to the shelter where Helen Deepneau is staying. Ralph and Lois save the residents. They then seek out Atropos and Ralph overcomes him, extracting a promise to stay out of their business, the doctors all being bound by their word. However when released, Atropos has his revenge by showing Ralph a glimpse of a car impact in the near future in which he takes the life of Natalie Deepneau, Helen's young daughter, in retaliation.

Time running very short, Ralph tells the other bald doctors that he will not stop Ed Deepneau, whatever the consequences for the multiverse, unless they allow him to save Natalie Deepneau by giving his life for her when the time comes. They are unable to decide, and a higher level entity in which they are in awe manifests briefly, stating that this will be allowed. He and Lois finally learn that "almost all of reality has stopped to watch the events unfolding" as they affect all of reality, and that the target of the Crimson King's attack is not the speaker at the meeting, as they had imagined, but a young boy who had been in the shelter and will be in the audience at the talk; the boy, Patrick Danville, is the focus of a prophecy concerning the salvation of The Dark Tower and will perform an action later in his life that is essential to preserve the multiverse.

Ralph fights both Ed Deepneau on his plane, and also the Crimson King who manifests to prevent him from interrupting Ed's mission, and succeeds in causing the plane to crash some distance from the center as Ralph leaves the level on which the plane is crashing, and survives. He and Lois fall in love and get married, and gradually forget the events which brought them together. In an epilogue some years later, Ralph (but not Lois this time) again starts to wake up early and see auras, and eventually remembers his promise to exchange his life for Natalie's. Understanding that the time has come, he walks to the shops in time to see the car shown to him by Atropos arrive and veer towards Natalie. Ralph pushes Natalie to safety, losing his own life in the process, but dies peacefully with Lois and the two bald doctors who are agents of the Purpose at his side.</p>
