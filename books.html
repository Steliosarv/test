<li><img id="myImg" src="images.jpg" alt="image with map"  ></li><p><u>Plot</u></p><br><p>In a future so real and near it might be now, something happens when women go to sleep; they become shrouded in a cocoon-like gauze. 

If they are awakened, and the gauze wrapping their bodies is disturbed or violated, the women become feral and spectacularly violent; and while they sleep they go to another place. 

The men of our world are abandoned, left to their increasingly primal devices. One woman, however, the mysterious Evie, is immune to the blessing or curse of the sleeping disease. 

Is Evie a medical anomaly to be studied, or is she a demon who must be slain?</p>

<li><img id="myImg2" src="images (2).jpg" alt="image with map"  ></li><p><u>Plot</u></p><p>The novel begins with the tone of a police procedural in its early parts, but shifts to a horror novel toward the end, employing two common genres of Stephen King. However, the plot is wholly consistent and split into several titled sections, each section containing multiple chapters. In addition, there is a small epilogue following the climax. The sections are ordered according to date in relativity to the inciting incident. The first section in the fictional town of Flint City, Oklahoma. Police detective Ralph Anderson arrests popular teacher and Little League Baseball coach Terry Maitland in front of a crowd of baseball game spectators, charging him with raping, killing, and mutilating an 11-year-old boy. The town quickly turns against Maitland. Maitland insists he is innocent, and hires elderly lawyer Howie Gold to assist him, but Anderson has eyewitnesses and clear physical evidence (DNA and fingerprints) of his guilt. In the meantime, eager reporters harass Terry's wife, Marcy, and his two daughters, Sarah and Grace.</p>

<li><img src="images (3).jpg" alt="image with map" ></li><p><u>Plot</u></p><p>Retired detective Bill Hodges, who now with his sidekick Holly runs the private investigation agency Finders Keepers, is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Given only months to live, he finds himself drawn into a recent spree of suicides. All the dead are connected by a common thread: each of them have, in the past, been in contact with mass murderer Brady Hartsfield, the notorious Mr. Mercedes who, six years ago, plotted a follow up mass murder of blowing up a rock concert venue packed with teenagers. Hodges and Holly thwarted Brady's plans and left the killer in a vegetative state from which he never regained consciousness. However, many of the staff in the hospital where Brady now resides believe that he is recovering at an impossible rate, and that he may be faking his injuries to avoid trial ... except that everyone who gets too close to proving this suspicion seems to have died by suicide.

After his head injury, Brady found himself gaining new abilities, including the power to move small objects with his mind and the ability to enter the bodies of certain people susceptible to his mental domination. Still confined to his hospital bed, Brady has used his power to finish his murderous work by creating a hypnotic video game app that heightens the user's susceptibility. Once the users are in Brady's control, he uses the app to dominate their minds and persuade them to commit suicide. The targets are the very teenagers who escaped death when Brady's plan to destroy the concert venue failed. Brady's ultimate goal, however, is to lure Hodges into the game and exact revenge. Brady uses the bodies of both a corrupt neurosurgeon and a hospital librarian as puppets and red herrings to do his dirty work and to misdirect the police while he makes his final move to destroy Hodges, all the while unaware that Hodges is already racing the clock against his own death.</p>

<li><img src="images (4).jpg" alt="image with map" ></li><p><u>Plot</u></p><p>During a heavy rainstorm in Derry, Maine, six-year-old Georgie Denbrough is chasing a paper boat that was given to him by his older brother, Bill, down a gutter. The boat is washed down a storm drain and Georgie peers in, seeing a pair of glowing yellow eyes. Georgie is confronted by a man dressed in a silver clown suit who introduces himself as "Mr. Bob Gray", a.k.a. "Pennywise the Dancing Clown". Pennywise offers Georgie a balloon which he cautiously refuses. The clown then entices Georgie to reach into the drain to retrieve his boat; he then severs Georgie's arm and leaves him to bleed to death.

The following June, Ben Hanscom, an overweight, 11-year-old boy, is harassed by a gang of bullies led by the feared Henry Bowers. On the last day of school, Ben hides from his tormentors in the Barrens after an altercation with the Bowers Gang. Ben befriends Eddie Kaspbrak and Bill Denbrough, Georgie's stuttering older brother. The three boys later befriend fellow misfits Richie Tozier, Stan Uris, and Beverly Marsh, forming the "Losers Club". In July of the same summer, the Losers are joined by Mike Hanlon.

As the summer draws on, the Losers realize that they have each had an encounter with a seemingly omniscient, prehistoric shape-shifting alien entity which takes the form of whatever they fear the most: Ben saw him as a mummy, Eddie as a leper, Bill as Georgie's ghost, Richie as a werewolf, Stan as two drowned boys, Mike as a flesh-eating bird that vaguely resembles Rodan, and Beverly as a fountain of blood spurting from her bathroom sink. Due to the unknown origin of the monster, the Losers refer to the creature as "It" and link It with a series of recent child murders, including that of Edward "Eddie" Corcoran, who is killed by the monster in the form of the Gill-man.

The Losers begin to suspect that It has control over Derry due to the number of unsolved disappearances and violent tragedies which go unnoticed or seem to be forgotten by the adults in the town. They begin to investigate It's origins, discovering that It is immortal and arrived in Derry millions of years ago. The Losers also learned that It awakens every 27 years from a slumber in the town's sewers, usually after a terrible event or tragedy, and feeds for 12 to 16 months.

The Losers decide to put an end to It and Ben makes two silver slugs out of a silver dollar, believing that silver will harm It. The kids go to the house on Neibolt Street where Eddie, Bill, and Richie had previously encountered It. It attacks them in the form of a werewolf. However, Beverly shoots a slug from Bill's slingshot, injuring It, and causing It to flee back to the sewers. Two weeks later, Beverly returns home, where her abusive father attacks her and attempts to rape and kill her. Beverly manages to escape. Henry, accompanied by his two closest friends, Victor "Vic" Criss and Reginald "Belch" Huggins, chases the Losers into the sewers, with the intention of killing them.

The narrative changes, and "It" informs the reader that it existed originally in a void between our universe and others, in a dimension known as the Macroverse. It boasts of its own superiority to anything on planet Earth. It also explains that it chooses to prey on children because their fears are easier to interpret in a physical form. It expresses its own fear that It might not be the only eternal being in existence. It suspects there might be Another, and that the children could be the agents of this Other. This might explain their power and unprecedented ability to harm It.

Back in the sewers, It attacks the three bullies in the form of Frankenstein's monster, ripping Vic's head off and mutilating Belch's face. Henry, driven insane from seeing his friends killed, chases after the Losers and gets lost. He eventually washes out of the sewers into a nearby river and is blamed for all of the child murders. Meanwhile, Bill discovers the "Ritual of Chüd", allowing him to enter the Macroverse to confront It and discover It's true form; a mass of destructive orange lights referred to as the "Deadlights". During the ritual, Bill also encounters "The Turtle", an ancient being, possibly more ancient than It, that created the universe while vomiting after a stomach-ache. The Turtle explains that It can only be defeated during a battle of wills. Through it, Bill also learns of yet another being: the Final Other. This Other is a force beyond the universe, the creator of the Turtle, and maybe even It. With the help of The Turtle, Bill is able to defeat It and send it back to its slumber. After the battle, the Losers get lost in the sewers until Beverly has sex with all the boys to connect childhood and adulthood while bringing unity back to the group. The Losers swear a blood oath to return to Derry, should It return in the future</p>

<li><img src="images (6).jpg" alt="image with map" ></li><p><u>Plot</u></p><p>The prologue introduces the two main characters. In 1953, a young boy named John Smith is knocked unconscious while ice-skating, When recovering, he mumbles a strange message ("Don't jump it no more") to an adult on the scene. The knot on Johnny's head fades after a few days, and he thinks no more of it. A few months later, the adult is seriously injured while he tries to jump start a car. Two years later, during an unconnected incident in Iowa, a young door to door Bible salesman, Greg Stillson, who suffers emotional issues and dreaming of greatness, vindictively kicks an aggressive dog to death.

By 1970, Johnny is now a high school teacher in eastern Maine. After visiting a county fair with his girlfriend, Sarah, and eerily winning repeatedly at the wheel of fortune, Johnny is involved in a car accident on his way home which lands him in a coma for four and a half years. Upon waking, Johnny finds that he has suffered neural injury, but when he touches people and objects, he is able to tell them things that they did not know. For example, he knows that a nurse's son would have successful surgery; states that his doctor's mother, long believed dead, is living in Carmel, California; warns his physical therapist that her house is about to burn down; tells Sarah that her lost wedding ring is in her suitcase pocket; and later recounts the story behind a St. Christopher medallion that is owned by a skeptical reporter.

Johnny shrugs off local media reports of his supposed psychic talents and accepts an offer to resume teaching, but he begins to suffer from severe headaches. Richard Dees, a reporter for the national tabloid Inside View, makes an unsolicited visit to Johnny's house to offer him a lucrative position: writing psychic predictions for the newspaper. When Dees explains that they would essentially be running only fake predictions under Johnny's name, Johnny violently ejects him from the property. In retaliation, Inside View maliciously prints a story denouncing his clairvoyance as phony, but that brings Johnny relief, he now hopes to resume a normal life.

The hope is soon broken, however, when he is contacted by Sheriff George Bannerman who is desperate to solve a series of murders. Johnny is initially reluctant to publicize his abilities further but changes his mind after a nine-year-old becomes the killer's latest victim. Johnny's extra sense provides enough detail to identify the killer; Bannerman's deputy Frank Dodd, a sexual sadist who commits suicide and leaves a confession after seeing Johnny at the scene. The nationally reported incident reignites the public's interest in Johnny's clairvoyance.

Stillson, now a successful businessman and elected mayor of Ridgeway, New Hampshire, still suffers from his emotional problems. Asked to "straighten out" a friend's teenaged nephew for wearing an obscene T-shirt, he sets the shirt on fire, terrorizes the youth with a broken bottle, and threatens to kill him if he tells anyone. In 1976, he decides to run an independent campaign for a seat in the House of Representatives and blackmails a local businessman into raising funds for him.

Johnny's offer to return to his teaching job is rescinded as he is considered "too controversial to be effective as a teacher." He moves to New Hampshire and takes a job as a tutor for a wealthy young man, Chuck. He also takes up an interest in politics and becomes concerned when he watches a rally for Stillson. Johnny attends a rally for Stillson and, on touching his hand, has a horrific vision of an older Stillson who, as President, causes a massive, worldwide nuclear conflict.

Johnny's health starts to worsen. He contemplates how he might prevent Stillson's presidency and compares the matter to the question of whether one could kill Hitler in 1932 if time travel were possible. Eventually, he concludes that the only certain way to avoid the terrible future he has seen is to assassinate Stillson ("You can't run for President if you're a corpse"), but he procrastinates. He rationalizes his inaction is because of doubt in the vision he has seen and his abhorrence of murder as well as his belief that there is no urgent need to act immediately. As Johnny continues to contemplate the matter, he has another vision and warns Chuck not to go to his high school graduation party because the facility will be struck by lightning and will burn down. Chuck's father agrees to host an alternative party for Chuck and other students, but their party at home is interrupted by news of a lightning strike and many deaths at the original venue. Johnny also learns that an FBI agent, who had been investigating Stillson, had been murdered with a car bomb.

Johnny moves to Phoenix, where he takes a job as a road maintenance technician for the local Public Works Department. He learns that his headaches and blackouts are caused by a brain tumor and that without treatment, he has only a few months left to live (that is stated only in the epilogue). Johnny takes the fire at the party as a warning: he knew that the fire would happen but did not take that seriously enough and so people died. Realizing that he will not live much longer whatever he decides, Johnny refuses surgery and buys a rifle to shoot Stillson at the next rally.

At the rally, Stillson begins his speech. Johnny attempts to shoot Stillson but misses and is wounded by Stillson's bodyguards. Before he can fire again, Stillson grabs a young child and holds him up as a human shield. Johnny pauses, unable to shoot, and is shot twice by the bodyguards. He falls off the balcony and fatally injures himself.

A bystander photographs Stillson in the act of using the child as a shield, and when published, the picture destroys Stillson's political future.

Dying, Johnny touches Stillson a final time but feels only dwindling impressions and knows that the terrible future has been prevented.

An epilogue, "Notes from the Dead Zone", intersperses excerpts of letters from Johnny to his loved ones, a "Q & A" transcript of a purported Senate committee (chaired by real-life Maine Senator William Cohen) investigation of Johnny's attempt to assassinate Stillson, and a narrative of Sarah's visit to Johnny's grave. Sarah feels a brief moment of psychic contact with Johnny's spirit and, comforted, drives away.</p>
